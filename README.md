# Tasks
Create a command-line script, preferably in Bash, PHP, Node, or Python to perform the following tasks:

- [ ]  Check if `docker` and `docker-compose` is installed on the system. If not present, install the missing packages.
- [ ]  The script should be able to create a WordPress site using the latest WordPress Version. Please provide a way for the user to provide the site name as a command-line argument.
- [ ]  It must be a LEMP stack running inside containers (Docker) and a docker-compose file is a must.
- [ ]  Create a `/etc/hosts` entry for *example.com* pointing to localhost. Here we are assuming the user has provided *example.com* as the site name.
- [ ]  Prompt the user to open *example.com* in a browser if all goes well and the site is up and healthy.
- [ ]  Add another subcommand to enable/disable the site (stopping/starting the containers)
- [ ]  Add one more subcommand to delete the site (deleting containers and local files).
